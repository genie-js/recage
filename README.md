Age of Empires 2 Recorded Game parser in Node.js.

Only somewhat-supports UserPatch 1.4 somewhat-officially. Not tested with other versions yet. Reads Rec game bodies somewhat-reliably, reads map data from headers somewhat-reliably, does not read anything else.

If you want something that works, try [PHP RecAnalyst](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/recanalyst) for now.
